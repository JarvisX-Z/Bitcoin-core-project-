🔥I've created a focused C++ project that implements core concepts of Bitcoin using fundamental data structures.
Key Bitcoin Concepts Implemented:

   *Blockchain Structure: A sequence of "Blocks" linked together by cryptographic hashes (a specialized linked list).

   *Proof of Work (Mining): A mining algorithm that simulates finding a nonce to satisfy a network difficulty level.

   *Data Integrity: Logic to verify the entire chain's validity, ensuring no previous transactions were tampered with.

   *Transaction Handling: A simple way to store and visualize Bitcoin-themed transactions within blocks.

📎Technical Details:
Language: C++ (compiled with clang++).
Data Structures: std::vector for the chain, std::string for hashing, and struct/class for block encapsulation.
Hashing: A deterministic hashing function to demonstrate how data changes affect block hashes.
